# About me
Hello there, I'm **Chooi Guan** (Yes, that's my first name).  This repo contains work and references that I've done through my career.  I have worked across various roles and domains throughout my life, and presently I work as a Cloud architect specialising in Cloud and DevOps.  I'm also very familiar on the business side of things, having run <a href="https://www.skyjuicesoftware.com" target="_blank">Skyjuice Software</a>.  As a teenager studying for my diploma, I wrote my first peice of software which I sold to a pharmeceutical company (Agouron Pharmaceuticals).  Before finishing my college degree, I was already writing and selling software to Fortune companies like Amazon, P&G, Boeing, Rockstar Games as well as many other companies and individuals with a customer base in the thousands.  I am an educator and contribute to the creation and evaluation of public technical certifications and content on platforms such as Coursera and professional certification authorities such as <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/b0696bad-7654-4819-b291-b3ecf8c37447/public_url" target="_blank">CompTIA</a>.  I utilise my technical skills, ability to work with others and deliver quality software, to travel and live around the world.  As of this writing, I have lived and worked in some of the best and well known companies in the world in 5 countries over 3 continents for over 17 years.  One of my life goals is to live and work in North America.  I hold an accredited Executive MBA and also an <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0u3qd88r9m3btff/options_advanced.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">options trader</a> and have been trading professionally since 2019.  Personally I've traded other derivatives but options is my bread and butter.
